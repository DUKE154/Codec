# Codec
A codec is a computer program that encodes or decodes digital data - the word itself is short for “coder-decoder,” or “compressor-decompressor.”
I made a GUI  to compress a txt file into gzip file and decode the encoded text file. 
It was able to compress a file of size 1.21 MB to 501 KB .GUI was made using Java Swing and awt.
